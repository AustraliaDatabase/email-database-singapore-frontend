      <p>
        We provide our clients a massive realtor email list of about 2.31
        million entries. That is a robust set of data at your disposal, which
        will provide you with a lot of options as you fine tune your marketing
        strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our database is verified and audited every three months to ensure its
        integrity. We perform both manual and automated audits on our systems.
        This helps ensure that every entry and field is accurate and updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we let &quot;human eyes,&quot; so to speak, look at each database entry?
        Automated data verification systems work well; there is no doubt about
        that. But that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think nothing in this industry is perfect, especially if you use
        business contacts for marketing. Along the way, things can go wrong. So,
        we hire editors with a lot of experience to go through our data and find
        the few mistakes that got there by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why we can confidently provide our clients with a 95%
        Deliverability guarantee. What does that mean? We guarantee that the
        information that you get from our databases will be 95% accurate.
