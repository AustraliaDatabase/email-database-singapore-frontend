      InfoUSA is known to charge higher rates compared to EmailDatas. It's important to note that EmailDatas.com aims to provide an affordable alternative for businesses and companies seeking to improve their contact list.
      <br />
      <br />
      Here are the main reasons to use EmailDatas instead of InfoUSA:
      <br /> <br /> 

      <ul>
  <li>InfoUSA leads are 20 times more expensive than EmailDatas.com leads. EmailDatas.com aims to provide an affordable alternative for businesses and companies looking to improve their contact list.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Email leads provided by EmailDatas are more accurate than InfoUSA data. EmailDatas discovers and organizes real-time data to make sure it’s relevant and up-to-date. You can easily transfer the data to HubSpot, Mailchimp, and other platforms with just a click.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Get higher ROI from EmailDatas even with a limited budget. Acquiring, managing, and retaining customers is quite challenging for small businesses and most startups. EmailDatas can efficiently provide low-cost sales leads, local search, direct mail, and other marketing solutions.</li>
  <br />
  <li>EmailDatas offers emails, direct mail addresses, phone numbers of individuals and companies. The email list site also provides data processing, address standardization, email appending, data suppression, and many other services. <br /> More importantly, their email marketing service includes email prospecting, email maintenance, and email campaigns.</li>
  <br /><br />
  <li>EmailDatas builds email and mail lists based on client requirements. A business mailing list can generate higher conversion rates for different types of businesses. While building up an email list, you can also promote other products for better revenue. In fact, it’s the main reason why e-commerce giants continue to grow.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Currently, there are over 500 job titles for sale at more affordable rates. Building a mailing list by job title is easier to manage and utilize than the email marketing list provided by Infolist. With the job title, you will get other important details such as the number of contacts, email database price, complete price, and job title type.</li>
  <br />
  <li>EmailDatas provides categorized lists of C-Level, Director Level, VP Level, and Manager Level contacts on the website. Unlike InfoUSA's database, it also indicates finance, IT, and medical as job title types. A comprehensive business email list helps identify your market and provide them with the exact product or service they need.</li>
  <br />
  <li>EmailDatas serves all types of industries in the United States and lists them according to SIC codes for sale. Currently, there are over 40 million US mail lists that are up-to-date and verified, along with 10 million international B2B mail lists for companies to benefit from.</li>
</ul>
<br /> <br /> 

Having an up-to-date mailing list can significantly improve your conversion rates. An effective email building strategy can make it easier to manage your list and send relevant content to your target audience – people and companies who are genuinely interested in what you have to offer.

For instance, you can purchase a high-quality email list from EmailDatas and take advantage of organic leads that have better possibilities of converting to sales.
      <br /> <br /> 

These verified mailing details will help you provide better customer experiences for your target market. Additionally, they can help build long-term connections through retained customers. With pre-made lists, you can get a customized list of contacts you want to reach out to based on job titles, job levels, locations, ZIP codes, departments, SIC/NAICS codes, industries, revenues, and employees.

Using EmailDatas’ email leads offers several advantages for building email lists and marketing campaigns, including:

When it comes to pricing, InfoUSA isn't exactly transparent about their rates. Before deciding which database to use, it's important to ask for the actual cost to ensure you stay within your budget.

      Perhaps you're wondering why you should choose the USA business database over others. First and foremost, the significant benefits of this kind of sales platform cannot be ignored. The majority of highly successful e-commerce companies today started by building their email marketing database before anything else.
<br />
<br />
Only after you have established an email list can you focus on mastering your product or service offerings. This is because you begin to generate up to 90% of web traffic when you first develop an actual email contact list. Here's how EmailDatas builds their email marketing database:
<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>Full Name</li>
<li>Job Title</li>
<li>Contact Number</li>
<li>Company Name</li>
<li>Website</li>

<li>Street Address</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Number Of Employees</li>
<li>Department</li>
<li>Annual Revenue</li>

Recognizing the importance of offering the right service or product isn’t just the secret to successful business. It’s also important to reach out to your target market, especially those who really matter. For instance, generating revenue can be more effective through targeted mailing lists.

EmailDatas provides an effective tracking tool for mailing whereabouts, unlike InfoUSA. This helps you determine the activity of your emails and how far they have reached across your target market.
