            <h2>1. Data Processing Principles</h2>
            <h3>A. Information is collected in an automated way.</h3>
            <p>
              When you visit our Websites, our potential third-party partners
              and we automatically record information from your device and its
              software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service
              provider, platform type, the website from which you came, and the
              website to which you are going when you leave our Websites, a date
              and time stamp, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
              your device.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may receive or collect information about your device whenever
              you use a mobile device to access our Services, including
              identification numbers associated with your device (such as a
              unique device ID, IDFA, or Google AdID), device type, model, and
              manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model,
              phone, email, and any other apps that you have downloaded
              (“Technical Data”).
            </p>
            <h3>B. Others have provided the Information</h3>
            <p>
              Occasionally, we may link or merge the personal data we gather
              about you with the information we automatically collect. Because
              of this, we can give you a more personalized experience no matter
              how you engage with us.
            </p>
            <h3>C. Location Data</h3>
            <p>
              At this time, we do not collect your specific geolocation or any
              latitude and longitude information for you. It is possible to
              approximate the location of a device using some of the information
              we gather, such as an IP address, under some circumstances. In
              some situations, we associate your profile with the latitude and
              longitude of the center of a city or state that we have on file
              for you in order to improve our analytics and provide you with the
              most appropriate matches. This is a broad latitude and longitude
              coordinate system and does not correlate to your current or
              historical location.
            </p>
            <h3>D. Anonymization.</h3>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to anonymize and aggregate any personal
              information we gather (so that it does not directly identify you).
              We may utilize anonymized data for our commercial purposes,
              including testing our information technology systems, conducting
              research, analyzing data, improving our services, and developing
              new goods and features, among other things. We may also share this
              type of anonymized information with third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may not continue providing you with the linked services if you
              do not give us the necessary personal data. This is because sure
              of these services may be reliant on this information.
